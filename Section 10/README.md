# 42. Javascript story - from console to V8 engine
All about javascript story

# 43. How javascript executes the code - Behind the scene
code execution steps-
Source Code → Tokenizer → Parser → AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) → Bytecode (via Interpreter) → Execute → Hot Code Detected → JIT Compiles to Machine Code → Optimized Execution → Output (Console/DOM/etc).

# 46. Primitives in javascript
In JavaScript, primitives are immutable basic data types — string, number, boolean, null, undefined, bigint, and symbol — that hold single, simple values rather than objects.

# 47. Non Primitives in javascript
In JavaScript, non-primitive data types are mutable and reference-based — mainly object, array, and function — meaning they store references to memory locations rather than fixed values.
