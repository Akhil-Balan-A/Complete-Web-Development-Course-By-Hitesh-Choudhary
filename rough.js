// ðŸ“Œ apply() Problems
// Modify Problem 1 from call() to use apply() instead.

// Write a function introduce(greeting, punctuation) and call it with apply() passing arguments as an array.

// You have a function maxNumber that returns the largest number from given arguments. Use apply() to pass an array and get the result.

// Create a function multiply(factor1, factor2) that returns the product of this.base and factor1 * factor2. Use apply() with an object to calculate.

// ðŸ“Œ bind() Problems
// Create an object car with a method getDetails that logs "Car: <brand>, Model: <model>". Use bind() to store it in a variable and call it later.

// Write a function showInfo that logs "User: <username>". Bind it to different objects and call them separately.

// You have a function increment(step) that increases this.count by step. Bind it to an object and call it multiple times to increment count.

// Create a function display(message) that logs "Message for <name>: <message>". Bind it to an object with a name and use it for different messages.

// Have a method in an object that uses this inside setTimeout. Fix the this problem using bind() so that it works correctly.
